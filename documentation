# Architecture Overview

The environment consists of a centralized Splunk Enterprise server deployed on Windows,
receiving logs from an Ubuntu Linux agent and a Windows agent via Splunk Universal Forwarder.

Log forwarding is performed over port 9997, enabling centralized indexing and analysis
for SOC monitoring and threat detection.
